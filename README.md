## Welcome to SuperSlide ðŸŒˆ ðŸ’¦

### What is SuperSlide?

"What is SuperSlide?" you may ask. Why it is the newest and hottest react component library around (according to my wife).

### Why is SuperSlide?

I am glad you asked. And to that I say... "why not". Really I was just kind of bored one day while working on a project for a client and realized how bad their components were, so I figured I would start putting my own together. This is more of an exercise than anything else. I wanted to build better components and this is practice.


### Who is SuperSlide for?

Short answer; me. Longer answer; anyone. 

### Can you use it? 

If you want to then go right ahead. Keep in mind that: 
- __A__ - It isn't finished, 
- _2_ - I am only going to support it as far as I neede it supported, and 
- **_iii_** - I may never get past this commit if I am being really honest.

### What does it have?

Right now, not very much. There is a button component and an avatar component and both need some work. I started adding a card component and a toast component, but those are not even at version 1.

### What is is really for?

[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/). I wanted to learn Storybook and start building components with documentation and storied for usage since it is something sorely lacking in the project I am working on right now. There is someone that is trying to add support for it, but he is on another team and I am not likley to be assigned to that task, so I wanted a way to learn.
